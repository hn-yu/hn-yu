# Haonan Yu - Computational Chemistry

Hi there, it's Haonan Yu. I'm a fresh-year Ph.D. student at **School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University**.

I'm luckily advised by Prof. Zhiqiang Sun, co-advised by Dr. Hanzi Liu.

My previous experience is primarily focuses on Computer/Computational Science.

I'm currently working on:

- Computational Chemistry
- Nanoparticle/Surface/Lattice Structure
- AI for Energy Science

I believe that [Deep Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_management) yields the best. Keep away from recommand systems, attention is all you need!

I'm open to ideas, both theoretical and experimental. If you want to collaborate with me, please send me a **long** email.
