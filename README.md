# Haonan Yu - Computational Chemistry

Hi there, my name is Haonan Yu, I'm a fresh-year Ph.D. student at **School of Energy, Central South U**.

My previous expreience is mainly about Computer/Computational Science.

I'm currently working on:

- Computational Chemistry
- Nanoparticle/Surface/Lattice Structure
- AI for Energy Science

I believe that [Deep Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_management) yields the best, but when I can't concentrate, I like to browse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I'm open to ideas, both theoretical and exprimental. If you want to collaborate with me, you know what to do ;)
