# Haonan Yu - Computational Chemistry

Hi there, it's Haonan Yu here, I'm a fresh-year Ph.D. student at **School of Energy, Central South U**.

*Fun Fact: Haonan did not gain admission to the Master's program at this university but was accepted into the Doctoral program three years later, luckily advised by Prof. Zhiqiang Sun.*

Curriculum Vitae

My previous expreience is mainly about Computer/Computational Science.

> We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters. - Peter Thiel

I'm currently working on:

- Computational Chemistry
- Nanoparticle/Surface/Lattice Structure
- AI for Energy Science

I believe that [Deep Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_management) yields the best, but when I can't concentrate, I like to browse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

> I apologize for such a long letter. I didn't have time to write a short one. - Mark Twain

I'm open to ideas, both theoretical and exprimental. If you want to collaborate with me, please write me a **long** email.
