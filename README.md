# Haonan Yu - Computational Chemistry

Hi there, it's Haonan Yu. I'm a fresh-year Ph.D. student at **School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University**.

I'm luckily advised by Prof. Zhiqiang Sun, co-advised by Dr. Hanzi Liu.

My previous experience is primarily focuses on Computer/Computational Science.

I'm currently working on:

- Computational Chemistry
- Nanoparticle/Surface/Lattice Structure
- AI for Energy Science

I believe that [Deep Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_management) yields the best, but when I can't concentrate, I like to browse Hacker News.

I'm open to ideas, both theoretical and experimental. If you want to collaborate with me, please send me a **long** email.
