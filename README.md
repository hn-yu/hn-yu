# Haonan Yu - Computational Chemistry

Hi there, it's Haonan Yu. I'm a fresh-year Ph.D. student at **School of Energy Science and Engineering, Central South University**.

> Here is uh, here's my resume. I mean technically it says uh curriculum vitae. - Jesse Pinkman in the show "Breaking Bad"

My previous experience is primarily focuses on Computer/Computational Science.

I'm currently working on:

- Computational Chemistry
- Nanoparticle/Surface/Lattice Structure
- AI for Energy Science

I often switch between different tasks, just like a typical [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder); when my focus drifts, I browse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to reset my mind.

I'm open to ideas, both theoretical and experimental. If you want to collaborate with me, please send me a **long** email.
